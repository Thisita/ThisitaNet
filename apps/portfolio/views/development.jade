    h1 Development Experience
  p.lead I started programming at the age of ten developing Microsoft Windows software in Intel x386 assembly code with only the Intel reference manual and a hex editor. That being said I can program in C, C++, C++.NET, C#, Java, Delphi, HTML, JavaScript (for web, Adobe, and Node), CSS, PHP, MySQL, and Python.
  h2 Commercial Experience
  p I have commercial experience developing web applications and Hadoop-related applications in Java. This includes developing large data visualization engines, streaming data processing algorithms, user automation engines, REST APIs, and user driven analysis tools. I also have commercial experience developing and managing database systems, including database query optimization.
  p I have spent most of my research time developing desktop applications in C, C++, and C#. These applications range from Microsoft Office plugins, instant messenger plugins (including encryption), business-driven software, ports of pre-existing software, text analysis software, artificial intelligence agents (genetics, neural networks, and heuristic search), ASP.NET web applications, and visualization applications.
  p I have experience working in teams following Agile-like processes for products and research goals. In general, I use a strongly typed style of development with strongly defined documentation. I develop software using a rapid prototyping and constant testing, as a strict personal standard. I strongly believe that all code should be strongly typed, standardized, and documented for the sake of project maintenance.
  h2 University Experience
  p.pull-right <iframe width="320" height="240" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KGdWy2y4vs8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  p My career with the University has led me into developing multiple projects. This includes various implementations of standard library controls in C and Minix extensions in ANSI-C. Developing circuits controlled by the Motorola HC11 and M68K with control firmware in Assembly and ANSI-C including work on a shell based operating system. I have also developed software and circuits for the Raspberry Pi system. One Raspberry Pi project I have worked on is control of a Hexbug Spider XL and NodeJS REST communications infrastructure. I have experience implementing a plethora of search, heuristic search, and genetic algorithms for solving TSP problems. I have also implemented genetic algorithms for solving the game Lights Out.
  p I developed a cryptographically secure development environment using C# and ASP.NET for a Software Engineering course, as well. This development environment supports C, C++, and C++11x compilation of projects which are developed and stored using a cryptographic mechanism. This application makes use of PBKDF2 and AES256 along with best practices for key generation and password storage. It also includes a session management system which is compatible with network environments like TOR.
